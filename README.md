# The Paranoia Game
A mini-project exploring linked list data structures in C to implement a real-life simulation game where players are eliminated in rounds until a single winner remains.

Description
---
This project implements the Paranoia game using a custom linked list to manage players in two distinct lists: a circular target ring and an ordered tagged list. The program allows users to input player names dynamically, simulating the game's rounds by eliminating players and updating the lists accordingly. 

Key features include:
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Ensures the program handles unbounded player names and avoids memory leaks.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates user input gracefully, including cases where invalid names are entered or players are already eliminated.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Provides clear outputs each round, showing the current target ring and tagged list until a winner is determined.
- **Linked List Operations**: Implements list initialization, appending, removal, length calculation, and specialized printing functions for the game.

The project demonstrates skills in memory management, pointer manipulation, and interactive C programming while adhering to strict coding standards, including clear comments, proper indentation, and avoiding global variables.
